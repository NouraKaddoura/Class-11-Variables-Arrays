- create an array
- iterate through the array
- update the DOM using variables from the array

Also Start thinking about what you may want to do as a final project. 
Some examples are:

A blog 
A portfolio site (now using javascript and built from scratch)
A Shopping Page
A Dashboard
A game (we would have to talk about this first to make sure you don't pick one too complex for the scope of this class)

Do a rough wireframe of this idea. use Mockflow
